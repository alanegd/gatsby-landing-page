  SmartStock landing page
</h1>

This is a simple landing page made for a fictional software for inventory management called "SmartStock". I made this to showcase my Tailwind, CSS, HTML5 and JavaScript skills, and to learn more about Gatsby, a React-based open source framework. Feel free to open a pull request in case you have any suggestions to enhance this project.

## Technologies used

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/): React-based open source framework.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): CSS framework.
